poets sleep in graves,<br />
ache, feed on mulch,<br />
dig through<br />
dirt composing, arriving,<br />
art surviving through decaying, through<br /> 
<span class="blackout">Shall I compare thee to</span> a summer’s day<span class="blackout">?</span><br /> 
<span class="blackout">Thou</span> art more lovely, <span class="blackout">and more temperate:</span><br /> 
<span class="blackout">Rough winds do shake the</span> darling, <span class="blackout">buds of May,</span><br />
<span class="blackout">And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;</span><br />
<span class="blackout">Sometime too hot</span> the eye of heaven shines,<br />
<span class="blackout">And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;</span><br />
<span class="blackout">And every fair from fair sometime declines,</span><br />
<span class="blackout">By chance or</span> nature<span class="blackout">’s changing course untrimm'd;</span><br />
<span class="blackout">But thy</span> eternal. <span class="blackout">summer shall not fade,</span><br />
<span class="blackout">Nor lose</span> possession of <span class="blackout">that fair thou ow’st;</span><br />
<span class="blackout">Nor shall</span> death<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;brag <span class="blackout">thou wander’st in his shade,</span><br />
<span class="blackout">When in</span> eternal lines; <span class="blackout">to time thou grow’st:</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blackout">So long as</span> men can <span class="blackout">breathe or eyes can see,</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long live. <span class="blackout">s this, and this gives life to thee.</span>

beauty through such dust, tell me<br />
that if the dinosaurs knew how to write poetry,<br />
they would have done<br />
so<br />
with their ashes,<br />
prehistoric—put aside their story—date their carbon.<br />
this rot, this organic matter. that is<br />
all we yearn for;<br />
My heart aches, <span class="blackout">and a drowsy numbness</span> pains<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My senses<span class="blackout">, as though of hemlock I had drunk,</span><br />
<span class="blackout">Or emptied some dull</span> opiate to the <span class="blackout">drains</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blackout">One minute</span> past, <span class="blackout">and Lethe-wards had sunk:</span><br />
<span class="blackout">'Tis not through</span> envy <span class="blackout">of thy happy lot,</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blackout">But being too happy in thine happiness,—</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blackout">That thou, light-winged Dryad of</span> the trees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some melodious plot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of <span class="blackout">beechen green, and</span> shadows <span class="blackout">numberless,</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blackout">Singest of summer in full-throated ease.</span>

we can never lie where poets are buried,<br />
only watch over,<br />
grip tradition as if they would rise<br />
again and shudder, shun<br />
at the thought of modern poetry,<br />
though we wish to be buried inside their bone marrow,<br />
nest in the echoes of their cranium and shiver but<br />
refrain from begging for warmth,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;where did the warmth go?<br />
the warmth from the feelings of their words?—they like it cold—<br />
hugging the creaking wood of their casket to say:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, <span class="blackout">distinctly</span> I remember <span class="blackout">it was in the bleak December</span>;<br />
<span class="blackout">And each separate</span> dying, <span class="blackout">ember wrought its ghost</span> upon the floor,<span class="blackout">.</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blackout">Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blackout">From</span> my books <span class="blackout">surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—</span><br />
<span class="blackout">For the rare and radiant maiden</span> whom the angels name <span class="blackout">Lenore—</span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="blackout">Nameless here for</span> evermore.

<span class="blackout">Till</span> Seraphs <span class="blackout">swing their snowy Hats &mdash;</span><br />
And Saints &mdash; <span class="blackout">to windows run &mdash;</span><br />
<span class="blackout">To see</span> the <span class="blackout">little Tippler</span><br />
<span class="blackout">Leaning against the &mdash;</span> Sun<span class="blackout">!</span>

but

<span class="blackout">Daddy,</span> I have <span class="blackout">had</span> to kill you.<br />
<span class="blackout">You died before I had time——</span><br />
<span class="blackout">Marble-heavy,</span> a bag full of God,<br />
<span class="blackout">Ghastly statue with one gray toe</span><br />
<span class="blackout">Big as a Frisco seal</span>

if poetry needs to be sacred, holy<br />
revered but always dead,<br />
i will kill their ghosts with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spaces<br />
and blanks and<br />
enjambment, play<br />
with form and sound<br />
