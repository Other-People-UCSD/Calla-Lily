<p style="line-height: 0.8rem;">
perpendicular we lay<br />
&nbsp;vinyl hymns distracting me<br />
and you in this falling light<br />
&nbsp;noon suits you so easily
</p>

 <p style="line-height: 0.8rem;">
this sunlight whose love rivals my own<br />
&nbsp;taunting me by touching you<br />
effortlessly being accepted<br />
&nbsp;enveloping you <br />
like i want to, i want to
</p>

<p style="line-height: 0.8rem;">
they frolic on your hair<br />
&nbsp;the hair i messily dyed green<br />
now covered up brown <br />
&nbsp;and golden from all their dancing<br />
noon suits you so easily
</p>

<p style="line-height: 0.8rem;">
i watch you like this<br />
&nbsp;unaware of all the great stories <br />
they are writing about you<br />
&nbsp;and all the poems i cannot<br />
but i want to, i want to
</p>

<p style="line-height: 0.8rem;">
please donâ€™t keep me like this<br />
&nbsp;a scribbling automaton  <br />
let me back into the concave <br />
&nbsp;shapes of your body<br />
i have felt unfettered<br />
&nbsp;for far too long, too easily
</p>
