<img src="/images/2023/the-post-mortem-helen-huang.jpg" alt="Watercolor. Seven mangoes on a table with a small figure curled up in the center of one of them." class="w650" />

now that I’m dead, bury me in mangoes

none of that grotesque open-casket bullshit<br />
where they blot cheap eyeshadow over<br />
festering skin that is already beyond salvaging<br />
(can’t you feel my corpse<br />
rolling its eyes from the absurdity?)

and don’t believe the glassy-eyed assemblage of faces<br />
who ramble nonsense like<br /> <em>oh, she was such an angel...</em><br /> <em>oh, she died too young at twenty-one...</em>

I hate cliché decorum, <br />
but nowhere near as much as I hate that <br />
in twenty-one years I couldn’t escape from mediocrity<br />

<br />

even my death was probably unspectacular in the end<br />
(I imagine that I died from choking on<br />
a mango pit, or something to that effect)

trust me, I am no martyr,<br />
just another artist who gave up<br />
before she started,<br />
another idealist, romantic,<br />
naturalist wanting to believe in meaning<br />
carved from quarks and antiquarks

if there is an afterlife, I haven’t found it,<br />
but I sure hope the mangoes there<br />
don’t have preposterously large pits<br />
