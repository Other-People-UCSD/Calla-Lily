you wait up in the lighthouse,<br />
closer to god, closer to your miracle.<br />
you do not know how to live in a world<br />
where you are not loved–<br />
and so, you still believe.

but i stand at the cusp of the ocean,<br />
searching for the last terns to fly out.<br />
those migrating martyrs–<br />
all dead by next year.<br />
and yet, you still believe?

you keep tally marks up there–<br />
of days of unanswered prayers.<br />
i keep lists down here–<br />
of rows of species we drove to dust.

truth be told, i once trusted<br />
that if god foresaw the death of his earth,<br />
then he would not have<br />
made her so.

now i know this much–<br />
if humans wanted god’s unconditional love,<br />
unconditionally they would have<br />
kept his planet so.
