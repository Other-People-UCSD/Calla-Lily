Last week, he had two sinks in his bathroom,<br />
one handle to twist daily, one out of use.<br />
The door won’t close when I’m inside,<br />
he teaches me to lock in right,<br />
strain the hinges, hide the bruising.

Coyotes howl in his gutters when we leave,<br />
cars’ whirring blends into our slurring speech.<br />
Room number blurs as his staircase turns hazy,<br />
water pollution drips from his window to stain me.

In the mirror, my skin is translucent, veins bulge;<br />
he says I asked for it, honey-tongues his hard touch.<br />
Carved through my hip bones, his comfort expires,<br />
infection sets in and the pus kills desire.

He marks me down in his spreadsheet —<br />
not a girl, just an entry.<br />
Blood vessels burst like winter pipes at the memory.<br />
I turn frigid, shutter his house, leave no graves,<br />
leave no one to witness — I know what they’d say:<br />
<em>You are a fool for walking inside in the first place</em>.

Mold coats my shower, I bleach the soles of my shoes;<br />
rust in my locks, his ten years of rot leaching through.<br />
Curse his excuses, sleep with phantom regret,<br />
spit that apology into his gutter again.<br />
