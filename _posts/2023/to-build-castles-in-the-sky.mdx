  alt="The poem in the format Spencer wanted it. The first two stanzas are encapsulated in clouds and the third is in the shape of a lightning bolt." />

Up here, it’s easier<br />
To carve out home. How these towers<br />
Rise in cumulative stacks of cumulus!<br />
By the raised drawbridge, a portcullis catches<br />
Sunlight with gilded winks &mdash; such sneaky recognition of<br />
Your Excellency. A shallow moat beckons<br />
Beneath onlookers: come lounge under settled surf,<br />
Vanilla froth spinning anyone in<br />
A lazy, lazy lather.

Yet you dwell in the keep<br />
As if under siege. Inside billowing peaks<br />
Of cotton bale, the wallpaper<br />
Bursts with blueprints. You sleep late<br />
Upon potential energy, then a midday rise,<br />
A reach for crumpled sheets.<br />
From the parapet, you hang-dry dreams<br />
On clotheslines made ragged with regalia.<br />
This takes time, you tell me, convince me<br />
This final bundle’s too thickset to shrink<br />
As the cables, magnetized toward the terrestrial world,<br />
Shiver with weight,<br />
Release.

What a luxury<br />
It must be!<br />
To look out at<br />
The banal world,<br />
Reject it, depart<br />
Into the skies.<br />
If I stick my head<br />
Far enough in the clouds,<br />
Maybe I too<br />
Launch into aether, <br />
Attend astronaut orbit,<br />
Become the alchemist<br />
Whose finger-snap<br />
Would poof!<br />
Mold air into gold.
