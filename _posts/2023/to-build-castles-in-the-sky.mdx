Up here, it’s easier

To carve out home. How these towers

Rise in cumulative stacks of cumulus!

By the raised drawbridge, a portcullis catches

Sunlight with gilded winks &mdash; such sneaky recognition of

Your Excellency. A shallow moat beckons

Beneath onlookers: come lounge under settled surf,

Vanilla froth spinning anyone in

A lazy, lazy lather.

<br />

Yet you dwell in the keep

As if under siege. Inside billowing peaks

Of cotton bale, the wallpaper

Bursts with blueprints. You sleep late

Upon potential energy, then a midday rise,

A reach for crumpled sheets.

From the parapet, you hang-dry dreams

On clotheslines made ragged with regalia.

This takes time, you tell me, convince me

This final bundle’s too thickset to shrink

As the cables, magnetized toward the terrestrial world,

Shiver with weight,

Release.

<br />

What a luxury

It must be!

To look out at

The banal world,

Reject it, depart

Into the skies.

If I stick my head

Far enough in the clouds,

Maybe I too

Launch into aether, 

Attend astronaut orbit,

Become the alchemist

Whose finger-snap

Would poof!

Mold air into gold.
