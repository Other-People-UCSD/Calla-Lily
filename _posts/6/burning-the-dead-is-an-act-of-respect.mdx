there’s a legend that goes<br />
if you touch fire long enough,<br />
you’ll descend into earth’s crust.

you’ll tread the same path as Aeneas,<br />
and you’ll feel your lungs combust as you breathe.

but the real tragedy<br />
is learning how to dance with the bodies,<br />
scarred with ashes and atrophy.


<h2>drowning the dead is an act of respect</h2>

there’s a legend that goes<br />
if you leave the coastline of home,<br />
the sea eats you alive.

that boat will sink into an abyss,<br />
of stone cold ghosts and your next of kin.

but the real story ends<br />
in casting their corpses back into the depths,<br />
in rescue and mercy.
