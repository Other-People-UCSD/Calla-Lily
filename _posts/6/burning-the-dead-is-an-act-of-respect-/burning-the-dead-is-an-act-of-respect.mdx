there’s a legend that goes<br />
if you touch fire long enough,<br />
you’ll descend into earth’s crust.<br />
you’ll tread the same path as Aeneas,<br />
and you’ll feel your lungs combust as you breathe.<br />
but the real tragedy<br />
is learning how to dance with the bodies,<br />
scarred with ashes and atrophy.<br />
