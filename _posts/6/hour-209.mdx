i want to hear the seven colors of your voice<br />
to share with you the burning umber of cookies<br />
and lemon tang of sunburnt mornings<br />
i want to know every mountain on your skin<br />
to purge with rivers of unaccounted time<br />
the odor of shaved graphite and trails of ink<br />
i want to seek out all your groans and utterances i once sloughed<br />
to clasp them to my breast as a mother clasps a hideous babe<br />
before she sees its face:<br />
i want to push the rock across the wasteland<br />
as a celebration of the fools we are when we are together<br />

but we are apart.&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;and now iâ€™m wallowing in mounds of monstrous shit&mdash;of snorts<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and tissues and viruses and tylenol and dirty clothes and mantles of dust<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;shading my eyes in a separate sleet, as i wonder

<br />

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;if this savagery is all we are when we are alone
