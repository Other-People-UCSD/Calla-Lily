i wake up i am buffering /// 

for a moment there is only my idling\<br />

tongue, the clouded eyes in my head, the\<br />

amplified clicks of my own jaw /\<br />

three blinks and the lens swings softly\<br /> 

into focus; you and i are encased\<br />

products of chrysalis fluid /

the wire inside of us coaxed perfectly,\<br /> 

our limbs sitting neatly. proof we\<br /> 

fit together in this anomalous way. fated /\<br />

and in this clarity i am able to\<br />

admire your intricacies –\<br />


\[ the thin film just behind the shell of\<br /> 

your ear; the blessed crease of\<br /> 

your eyelid; the soft charcoal of\<br /> 

the shadows our bodies make ]\<br />

– in the same way i observe things that\<br /> 

are soft and that have transformed /\<br /> 

in this state i feel nothing that can\<br />

weigh me; i don’t even feel the ultimate\<br /> 

betrayal of my own mother /\<br />

amidst my fatigue, i manage a small\<br /> 

smile; i indulge in my safety, stare at the\<br />

nature of your skin, and decide i will\<br /> 

never tear my eyes away /\<br />

i do not remember when we cocooned,\<br /> 

but there is nothing more i’d want to have –\<br />

\[ the newly emerging thumps of\<br /> 

your heart; the closeness of\<br />

vermillion \[?]; the gentle parallel of\<br />

our blushed palms; reaching ]

– than only a rounded soft halve\<br />

of a pupa, made of our beating\<br /> 

feminine flesh
