i wake up i am buffering /// 

for a moment there is only my idling\<br />

tongue, the clouded eyes in my head, the\<br />

amplified clicks of my own jaw /\<br />

three blinks and the lens swings softly\<br /> 

into focus; you and i are encased\<br />

products of chrysalis fluid /

the wire inside of us coaxed perfectly,\<br /> 

our limbs sitting neatly. proof we\<br /> 

fit together in this anomalous way. fated /\<br />

and in this clarity i am able to\<br />

admire your intricacies –\<br />

i wake up i am buffering ///

for a moment there is only my idling

tongue, the clouded eyes in my head, the

amplified clicks of my own jaw /

three blinks and the lens swings softly

into focus; you and i are encased

products of chrysalis fluid /

the wire inside of us coaxed perfectly,

our limbs sitting neatly. proof we

fit together in this anomalous way. fated /

and in this clarity i am able to

admire your intricacies –

\[ the thin film just behind the shell of

your ear; the blessed crease of

your eyelid; the soft charcoal of

the shadows our bodies make ]

– in the same way i observe things that

are soft and that have transformed /

in this state i feel nothing that can

weigh me; i don’t even feel the ultimate

betrayal of my own mother /

amidst my fatigue, i manage a small

smile; i indulge in my safety, stare at the

nature of your skin, and decide i will

never tear my eyes away /

i do not remember when we cocooned,

but there is nothing more i’d want to have –

\[ the newly emerging thumps of

your heart; the closeness of

vermillion \[?]; the gentle parallel of

our blushed palms; reaching ]

– than only a rounded soft halve

of a pupa, made of our beating

feminine flesh
