They are painted completely in red, and the sharp black shadows of their legs in wide-legged pants cut towards the viewer and out of frame." class="w450" />

Let me put it in these terms,<br />
What does sorrow look like?<br />
I’m tired of making a spectacle<br />
I’m no art display<br />
Still feeling like a performance piece,<br />

So, where’s my Oscar?

<span class="black-out-blackout">‐ I’m not pretending. God please. <em>Please. Please. Please.</em></span><br /> <span class="black-out-blackout">‐ What will it take for you to believe me?</span>

Here’s the question again,<br />
What does sorrow look like? To you?<br />
Is it me hunched over with an ache in my stomach?<br />
My ribs as instruments beating over my chest, in song for you?<br />
Trauma, in the form of a story to be retold?

<span class="black-out-blackout">‐ This grief, you see? It’s in blood.</span>

Rhetor plagues me because how do you describe this<br />
Mess, that other, that pulses with the same beat as mine<br />
Fear paralyzes and I’m - I’m<br />
So tired of doing all these things expected and<br />

And

I have run out of words.<br />

What is myself?<br />
What is this idea of “self”?

Every morning I wake up with a temporary forgetfulness:<br />

<span class="black-out-blackout">‐ Because what is <em>me?</em></span>

Here’s all of the things I remembered from this morn: I<br />
love banana bread<br />
I love the sun on my hands but not in my eyes I<br />
love that I can love-

I’m looking for more but I can’t find it

Can you remember the first time we met?<br />
Because I don’t.

How do I know you again?

How much does honesty phase you?

<span class="black-out-blackout">‐ Look at my bared teeth and bones</span><br /> <span class="black-out-blackout">‐ This is who I am.</span><br />
