This /ˈdɑkjəˌment/ \[ 

Let me put it in these terms,<br />
What does sorrow look like?<br />
I’m tired of making a spectacle<br />
I’m no art display<br />
Still feeling like a performance piece,<br />

So, where’s my Oscar? 

\- I’m not pretending. God please. Please. Please. Please.<br />
\- What will it take for you to believe me? 

]

will be given directly \[ 

Here’s the question again,<br />
What does sorrow look like? To you?<br />
Is it me hunched over with an ache in my stomach?<br />
My ribs as instruments beating over my chest, in song for you?<br />
Trauma, in the form of a story to be retold? 

\- This grief, you see? It’s in blood. 

Rhetor plagues me because how do you describe this<br />
Mess, that other, that pulses with the same beat as mine<br />
Fear paralyzes and I’m - I’m<br />
So tired of doing all these things expected and<br />

And 

I have run out of words.<br />
]

to the above noted client \[ 

What is myself?<br />
What is this idea of “self”?<br />
Every morning I wake up with a temporary forgetfulness:<br />

\- Because what is me? 

Here’s all of the things I remembered from this morn: I love banana bread<br />
I love the sun on my hands but not in my eyes I<br />
love that I can love-

I’m looking for more but I can’t find it

Can you remember the first time we met?<br />
Because I don’t. 

How do I know you again? <br />
]

Thus no Release of Information<br /> document \[ 

How much does honesty phase you? 

\- Look at my bared teeth and bones<br />
\- This is who I am.<br />
]

is required.
