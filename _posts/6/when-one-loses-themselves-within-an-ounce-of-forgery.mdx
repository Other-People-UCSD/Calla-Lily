there is something about a gloomy day after a night of partying.<br />
about the vicinity of thoughts, heavy and unearthed.<br />
maybe i should         et could               et…<br />

my aim was always<br />
to please. and somebody<br />
once told me i must continue on paths;<br />
as salmon make their way to spawn and die in autumn,<br />
there was and always is, more<br />
than uttered, than visible.<br />

in tucson, i answered back in spanish.<br />
a man taken by effect, grinned a smile of surprise and cunning.<br />
asking if i am with my mom.<br />

no thats my friend, you fucking asshole.<br />

the wind blew heavily.<br />
reassuring me of my direction to the west.<br />
the sonoran desert of the bolaño chapters<br />
lied in his teeth<br />
as if we did not understand<br />
each                      other.
