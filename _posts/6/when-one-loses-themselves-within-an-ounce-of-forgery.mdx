there is something about a gloomy day after a night of partying.<br />
about the vicinity of thoughts, heavy and unearthed.<br />
maybe i should         et could               et…<br />

my aim was always<br />
to please. and somebody<br />
once told me i must continue on paths;<br />
as salmon make their way to spawn and die in autumn,<br />
there was and always is, more<br />
than uttered, than visible.<br />

in tucson, i answered back in spanish.<br /> <span class="when-one-loses-right">a man taken by effect, grinned a smile of surprise and cunning.</span><br /> <span class="when-one-loses-right">asking if i am with my mom.</span><br />

<p class="when-one-loses-200">no thats my friend, you fucking asshole.</p>

the wind blew heavily.<br /> <span class="when-one-loses-100">reassuring me of my direction to the west.</span> <span class="when-one-loses-right">the sonoran desert of the bolaño chapters</span><br /> <span class="when-one-loses-right">lied in his teeth</span><br /> <span class="when-one-loses-right">as if we did not understand</span><br />
each                      other.
