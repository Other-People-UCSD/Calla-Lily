<img src="/images/6/at-the-center-of-it-all-bohemia-clarke.png" alt="A black and white photograph looking down a sidewalk with a vanishing point in the distance. The sidewalk is framed by trees on either side, cast in extreme shadows so that the trees appear black in the foreground of the photo with light only filtering through in the background. Behind the trees on the right, cars line the road. Behind the trees on the right, the front of a building can be barely seen in the shadows." />

<img src="/images/6/at-the-center-of-it-all-2-bohemia-clarke.jpg" alt="A black and white photograph of three women dressed in sun dresses walking along a path in a garden surrounded by lush bushes. They are walking away from the camera. Behind them is a group of women on the otherside of shrubs growing along a simple but tall trellis. Above them, a tree leans and curves over them beneath a cloudless sky." />

The shot is framed by a tree trunk in the upper right corner, cutting across the sky seen through a break in the trees." />

To the left of the boy is a grassy field. On the other side of the river is a forest." />
