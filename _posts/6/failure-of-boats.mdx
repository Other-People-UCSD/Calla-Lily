I think the thought before<br />
it can turn into fruit. I eat the apple before<br />
the tree can grow. I polish the wood before<br />
it can become the boat.<br />
In these ways I drink bitter<br />
tea with someone falsely familiar and we laugh<br />
at all the silly people dancing next<br />
door ages behind us.<br />

With asinine assurance I plunge the iron<br />
<span class="failures-of-boats-center">rod into the row boat’s back and</span><br />
<span class="failures-of-boats-indent">contemplate the last act of Hamlet.</span><span class="failures-of-boats-100">Clots of wood form</span><br />
<span class="failures-of-boats-center">around my feet. I look down.</span><br />
<span class="failures-of-boats-right">Where has the dock gone?</span><br />
<span class="failures-of-boats-center failures-of-boats-and">&</span><br />
It becomes a list of things I need to come to terms with:<br />

1. *falling*<br />
   <span class="failures-of-boats-indent">trees that didn’t tell anyone (nor you) they would fall</span>
2. *tilted*<br />
   <span class="failures-of-boats-indent">houses that tell (just) you to go home</span>
3. *curved*<br />
   <span class="failures-of-boats-indent">wooden boats that sink despite you (desperately!) (& often) asking them not to.</span>
