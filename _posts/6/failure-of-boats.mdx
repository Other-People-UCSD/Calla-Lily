I think the thought before<br />
it can turn into fruit. I eat the apple before<br />
the tree can grow. I polish the wood before<br />
it can become the boat.<br />
In these ways I drink bitter<br />
tea with someone falsely familiar and we laugh<br />
at all the silly people dancing next<br />
door ages behind us.<br />
↕<br />
↕<br />
↕<br />
With asinine assurance I plunge the iron<br />
rod into the row boat’s back and<br />
contemplate the last act of Hamlet. 				Clots of wood form<br />
around my feet. I look down.<br />
Where has the dock gone?<br />
&<br />
It becomes a list of things I need to come to terms with:<br />

1. *falling*<br />
   trees that didn’t tell anyone (nor you) they would fall
2. *tilted*<br />
   houses that tell (just) you to go home
3. *curved*<br />
   wooden boats that sink despite you (desperately!) (& often) asking them not to.
