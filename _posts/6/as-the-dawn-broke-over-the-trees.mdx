When the forest falls silent and the air starts to curl,\<br />

When the guests who once trod there depart for the world:\<br />

Still stands there the garden in the heart of the wood,\<br />

Still sits a reminder of things that are good. 

Once crafted by hands that could carve out the dawn,\<br />

And when those hands left, then the task was passed on;\<br />

That Love couldn’t help but breathe into it life\<br />

And the world couldn’t help but bring it to strife.\<br />

But the garden that stood there, exceedingly kind,\<br />

Had no thoughts of blame in its vine-shrouded mind.\<br />

There were only the flowers, the trees, and the moon\<br />

There was only its guests, always gone far too soon.\<br /> 

For the garden knew nothing of wrongness, or right;\<br />

It had only seen beauty in the liquid moonlight\<br /> 

There was only the Jasmine in hedges it grew\<br /> 

There were only its keepers; it nurtured them, too.\<br /> 

And when, growing past it, those hands did depart,\<br />

The garden forgave in its soft soil heart\<br /> 

As they pushed past the Ivy, as the light pierced the sky,\<br /> 

It would vow that fore’er in its thoughts they would lie;\<br />

It kept them like lyrics, in each bird’s morning song,\<br />

And it swore they’d remain there, as its memory was long.\<br />

For the garden that stood there, a haven to all,\<br />

Loved each pair of footsteps that entered its walls.\<br />
