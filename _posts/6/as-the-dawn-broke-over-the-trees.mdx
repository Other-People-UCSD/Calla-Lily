When the forest falls silent and the air starts to curl,<br />
When the guests who once trod there depart for the world:<br />
Still stands there the garden in the heart of the wood,<br />
Still sits a reminder of things that are good.<br />
Once crafted by hands that could carve out the dawn,<br />
And when those hands left, then the task was passed on;<br />
That Love couldn’t help but breathe into it life<br />
And the world couldn’t help but bring it to strife.<br />
But the garden that stood there, exceedingly kind,<br />
Had no thoughts of blame in its vine-shrouded mind.<br />
There were only the flowers, the trees, and the moon<br />
There was only its guests, always gone far too soon.<br />
For the garden knew nothing of wrongness, or right;<br />
It had only seen beauty in the liquid moonlight<br />
There was only the Jasmine in hedges it grew<br />
There were only its keepers; it nurtured them, too.<br />
And when, growing past it, those hands did depart,<br />
The garden forgave in its soft soil heart<br />
As they pushed past the Ivy, as the light pierced the sky,<br />
It would vow that fore’er in its thoughts they would lie;<br />
It kept them like lyrics, in each bird’s morning song,<br />
And it swore they’d remain there, as its memory was long.<br />
For the garden that stood there, a haven to all,<br />
Loved each pair of footsteps that entered its walls.<br />
