Up here, it’s easier 

To carve out home. How these towers 

                Rise in cumulative stacks of cumulus! 

        By the raised drawbridge, a portcullis catches

  Sunlight with gilded winks – such sneaky recognition of 

Your Excellency. A shallow moat beckons  

 	Beneath onlookers: come lounge under settled surf, 

      Vanilla froth spinning anyone in 

                    		A lazy, lazy lather.
