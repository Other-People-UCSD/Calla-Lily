Dear UCSD wifi, you quirky gal,\
You’re the ultimate femme fatale:\
Mysterious, fragile, an insurmountable shell-\
Being cast from your side is unbearable hell.

You know you’re an affection fiend;\
You covet my attention, my jealous queen.\
You’ll connect with me as bright as dawn,\
But my crush snapchats me- suddenly, you’re gone.

Like an old lover’s lost caress,\
You’re mine one moment, memories the next.\
I am a member of your endless empire\
And your mere touch I do desire

But, like a long-distance high school romance,\
You never really had a chance\
Because last month I got unlimited data\
LTE is first; you’re now beta.
