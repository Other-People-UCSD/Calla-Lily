darling,<br />
you left me in a brittle<br />
tea-cookie state of mind, but<br />
i watched you crumble, three nights ago<br />
under dawn’s umbral shroud<br />
you left for work<br />
sisyphus of deadlines and late-night takeout<br />
a constant shadow under your eyes<br />
like fabric soft lavender<br />
nebulas–<br />
i waltz in a housewife’s theater<br />
for a small audience:<br />
the cat and the mice and the<br />
lone smiling jack-o-lantern,<br />
my own little fairytale<br />
panopticon.<br />
cold coffee mugs go sour<br />
on the half-set dining table<br />
and i’m taking notes on a crumbled grocery list

<br />

darling,<br />
in the hallway’s vacuum of sound<br />
i think about the space between chaos and nyx<br />
how we tucked our heads beneath the gossamer night<br />
laughter twinkling, lights i knew<br />
were already dead (or perhaps<br />
currently dying)<br />
whispered hymns of a promised future<br />
still brush against my ear and our faces were inches apart<br />
once.<br />
had i known<br />
looking back gave you permission to go<br />
i would’ve let the sun blind me,<br />
instead of knitting eyelashes against<br />
blustering doubts– you haunt like<br />
threadbare linens lost in october winds–<br />
i would’ve sailed through the kitchen with a mop<br />
against the banks of siren and styx–<br />
i would’ve,<br />
just to know you’d be home in time for dinner.

<br />

darling,<br />
eclipse season cycles through us<br />
banging in the silence with the echo of<br />
your left sneaker tossed in<br />
the laundry drum<br />
when the planets collide it will be<br />
with that same cacophony<br />
burning up retinas until every<br />
lightbulb and lovers’ spat<br />
is snuffed by your shadowy orbit

i hopelessly imagine a sliver of silver rings<br />
not yet swallowed by kitchen sinks;<br />
but when the skies shatter<br />
the moon has already died<br />
and in the coldness before the big bang<br />
a piece of me broke off<br />
catapulted down and burned up before<br />
it could even break ground

meteors without abandon<br />
can only go so far

<br />

p.s.<br />
at the altar,<br />
i already knew.<br />
our stardust rots just as<br />
all midnight pumpkins do.
