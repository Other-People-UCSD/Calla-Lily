My father can only sing in Hebrew,<br />
but I’m too old for singing now.<br />
The living room plays strangers’ music;<br />
I shut the door to drown it out.<br />
Back turned to his boarded window,<br />
he pulls ragged cushions off the couch.

At ten, we crouch in his closet-sized room,<br />
among hand-drawn birthday cards<br />
and his scuffed leather boots,<br />
so he can lead the words we recite:

*Adonai eloheinu*, our god but not mine,<br />
for he broke the centuries-old matrilineal line<br />
for my Irish Catholic mother who has custody now<br />
in a three-bedroom on the other side of town.

Call it exile, an order to leave:<br />
Rocking chair in the alley,<br />
faith in my parents’ old sheets.<br />
Now that I fill his full bed,<br />
he spreads out cushions to sleep.

We don’t sing at bedtime;<br />
I’m too old to be soothed<br />
by Baubie’s star necklace,<br />
plush bunnies, or old truths.<br />
Mouth the words of prayers<br />
he stole from Hebrew school,<br />
barren ritual of secular Jews.
