<sup>1.</sup>The land becomes the narrator, becomes what watches the narrator, becomes how the narrator watches himself.<br />
<sup>2.</sup>Dividing the word to signal what?<br />
<sup>3.</sup>Is the crew sad, or is the ship sad, or is the ship a stand-in for the crew? What’s that called?<br />
<sup>4.</sup>According to Wikipedia, a caravel is an important new kind of ship used by the Portuguese during the “Age of Discovery” to sail farther distances than they could before. Narrator and “you” are actively involved in imperialism.<br />
<sup>5.</sup>Who’s “you?” Note agency of “you,” rather than agency of Vanessa. Also, it’s called a synecdoche.<br />
<sup>6.</sup>Over there?<br />
<sup>7.</sup>Past tense — they realized they didn’t actually know this woman, and were just putting her on a pedestal?<br />
<sup>8.</sup>Latin…<br />
<sup>9.</sup>Author is writing to an audience that went to schools that taught Latin.<br />
<sup>10.</sup>That’s weird. Before they were acting like they didn’t have a choice to be taking this journey.<br />
<sup>11.</sup>Clock image is similar to the circular image in the first stanza. Poem seems to approach meaning but never reach it.<br />
<sup>12.</sup>She’s the subject of the sentence for once, but she seems impatient and depressed. What is she waiting for? Does she represent the expectations of the empire they’re acting on behalf of or a philosophy they’re growing disillusioned with?<br />
<sup>13.</sup>She’s the verb, not the agent.
